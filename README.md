# W1D2

## Problem Statement

Write a node program that takes in an ulimited number of command line arguments, goes through each and prints out the sum of them. If any argument is not a whole number, skip it. Do support negative numbers.

## Broken Down

- need to be read arguments from cli
- go through arguments
- sum the arguments
